			If you’ve ever read Dr. Seuss, you know a good portion of the Dolch word list already. In fact, every word in The Cat in the Hat is on the Dolch list. Dolch words are high frequency English vocabulary commonly  used to teach children to read. Learning to recognize them automatically can facilitate fluency in reading.<br> <br>
			Engaging oral language skills (the ability to listen and recognize speech), word recognition (the ability to read single printed words), and spelling are a great way to memorize Dolch words to improve your knowledge of the Dolch word list.<br><br>
			Dolch words, also known as sight words, account for between 50-75% of all vocabulary found in grade school reading material. However, it isn’t just grade school children who can benefit from learning the Dolch word list. Individuals with dyslexia and other learning difficulties may find memorizing the list a useful activity because it facilitates the development of reading and spelling skills.
