			Dyslexia is a word we use to describe a difference in the way that someone's brain works. It means that your brain looks at information like letters and numbers in a different way. This can make it hard to read and write, or make maths tricky. It can even make concentration and organisation harder.<br><br>
			Everyone with dyslexia is different so each person will have their own strengths and weaknesses. It's important to remember that dyslexia doesn't mean that you're not clever. There are lots of very successful people who are dyslexic such as Tom Cruise, Darcey Bussell, Steven Spielberg and Richard Branson.<br><br>
			Dyslexia can make you feel frustrated and angry at times because it's harder to do things like schoolwork that some of your friends may find easy. Sometimes it's really hard to talk about these feelings with your friends and family, but there are organisations that understand and can give you help and support.
